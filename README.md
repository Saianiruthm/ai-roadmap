# 🤖 AI Self-Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my personal learning repository! This project documents my structured journey through the foundational and advanced concepts of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI, based on a comprehensive self-learning plan.

This repository serves as my "lab notebook," containing all my code, projects, notes, and experiments as I progress through each phase.

## Learning Plan Overview

My learning plan is divided into several key phases:

* **Phase 1: Mathematical Foundations**
    * Linear Algebra for ML
    * Calculus for Optimization
    * Statistics & Probability
* **Phase 2: Programming & Data Manipulation**
    * Python Fundamentals
    * NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization
    * SQL
* **Phase 3: Core Machine Learning**
    * Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
    * Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
    * Unsupervised Learning (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction)
* **Phase 4: Deep Learning Fundamentals**
    * Neural Networks from scratch
    * PyTorch & TensorFlow
    * CNNs (Computer Vision) & RNNs/LSTMs (Sequences)
    * Transformers, Attention, BERT, and GPT
* **Phase 5: Generative AI & Large Language Models**
    * LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Engineering
    * Fine-Tuning (PEFT, LoRA)
    * Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    * LLM Application Frameworks (LangChain)
* **Phase 6: MLOps & Production Systems**
    * (Future Goal) Containerization (Docker), Cloud Deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure), and CI/CD.
* **Phase 7: Capstone Projects**
    * (Future Goal) Building and deploying end-to-end applications.

## How to Follow My Progress

You can explore the folders in this repository, which are organized by phase. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and projects corresponding to the modules in my plan.
